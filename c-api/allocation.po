"Initialize a newly allocated object *op* with its type and initial "
"reference.  Returns the initialized object.  Other fields of the object are "
"not initialized.  Despite its name, this function is unrelated to the "
"object's :meth:`~object.__init__` method (:c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_init` "
"slot).  Specifically, this function does **not** call the object's :meth:`!"
"__init__` method."

"In general, consider this function to be a low-level routine. Use :c:member:"

"This function only initializes the object's memory corresponding to the "

msgid ""
"Allocates a new Python object using the C structure type *TYPE* and the "
"Python type object *typeobj* (``PyTypeObject*``) by calling :c:func:"

"`PyObject_Init`.  The caller will own the only reference to the object (i.e. "
"its reference count will be one)."

msgstr ""

"When populating a type's :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_alloc` slot, :c:func:"

"this macro."
msgstr ""

"This macro does not call :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_alloc`, :c:member:"
