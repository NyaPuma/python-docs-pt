"Generator objects are what Python uses to implement generator iterators. "
"They are normally created by iterating over a function that yields values, "
"rather than explicitly calling :c:func:`PyGen_New` or :c:func:"
"`PyGen_NewWithQualName`."

msgid "The C structure used for generator objects."

msgid "The type object corresponding to generator objects."

msgid ""
"Return true if *ob* is a generator object; *ob* must not be ``NULL``.  This "
"function always succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return true if *ob*'s type is :c:type:`PyGen_Type`; *ob* must not be "
"``NULL``.  This function always succeeds."

"Create and return a new generator object based on the *frame* object. A "
"reference to *frame* is stolen by this function. The argument must not be "
"``NULL``."

msgid ""
"Create and return a new generator object based on the *frame* object, with "
"``__name__`` and ``__qualname__`` set to *name* and *qualname*. A reference "
"to *frame* is stolen by this function.  The *frame* argument must not be "
"``NULL``."

msgid ":pep:`525`"

msgid ""
"The type object corresponding to asynchronous generator objects. This is "

"Create a new asynchronous generator wrapping *frame*, with ``__name__`` and "

msgid "Deprecated API"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a :term:`soft deprecated` API that was included in Python's C API by "
