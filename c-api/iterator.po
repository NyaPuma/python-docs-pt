"Python provides two general-purpose iterator objects.  The first, a sequence "
"iterator, works with an arbitrary sequence supporting the :meth:`~object."
"__getitem__` method.  The second works with a callable object and a sentinel "
"value, calling the callable for each item in the sequence, and ending the "
"iteration when the sentinel value is returned."

msgid ""
"Type object for iterator objects returned by :c:func:`PySeqIter_New` and the "
"one-argument form of the :func:`iter` built-in function for built-in "
"sequence types."

"Return true if the type of *op* is :c:data:`PySeqIter_Type`.  This function "
"always succeeds."

"Return an iterator that works with a general sequence object, *seq*.  The "
"iteration ends when the sequence raises :exc:`IndexError` for the "
"subscripting operation."

"Type object for iterator objects returned by :c:func:`PyCallIter_New` and "

"Return true if the type of *op* is :c:data:`PyCallIter_Type`.  This function "
"always succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a new iterator.  The first parameter, *callable*, can be any Python "
"callable object that can be called with no parameters; each call to it "
"should return the next item in the iteration.  When *callable* returns a "
"value equal to *sentinel*, the iteration will be terminated."

msgid "Range Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid "The type object for :class:`range` objects."

msgid ""
"Return true if the object *o* is an instance of a :class:`range` object. "
"This function always succeeds."

"These are built-in iteration types that are included in Python's C API, but "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that there is no guarantee that a given built-in type uses a given "
"iterator type. For example, iterating over :class:`range` will use one of "
"two iterator types depending on the size of the range. Other types may start "
"using a similar scheme in the future, without warning."
