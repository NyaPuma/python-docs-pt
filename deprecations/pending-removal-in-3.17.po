"Use ``isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Buffer)`` to test if ``obj`` "
"implements the :ref:`buffer protocol <bufferobjects>` at runtime. For use in "
"type annotations, either use :class:`~collections.abc.Buffer` or a union "
"that explicitly specifies the types your code supports (e.g., ``bytes | "
"bytearray | memoryview``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`!ByteString` was originally intended to be an abstract class that "
"would serve as a supertype of both :class:`bytes` and :class:`bytearray`. "
"However, since the ABC never had any methods, knowing that an object was an "
"instance of :class:`!ByteString` never actually told you anything useful "
"about the object. Other common buffer types such as :class:`memoryview` were "
"also never understood as subtypes of :class:`!ByteString` (either at runtime "
"or by static type checkers)."

msgid ":mod:`typing`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before Python 3.14, old-style unions were implemented using the private "
"class ``typing._UnionGenericAlias``. This class is no longer needed for the "
"implementation, but it has been retained for backward compatibility, with "
"removal scheduled for Python 3.17. Users should use documented introspection "
"helpers like :func:`typing.get_origin` and :func:`typing.get_args` instead "
"of relying on private implementation details."

msgid ""
":class:`typing.ByteString`, deprecated since Python 3.9, is scheduled for "
"removal in Python 3.17."
