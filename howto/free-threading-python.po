msgid "Python support for free threading"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Starting with the 3.13 release, CPython has support for a build of Python "
"called :term:`free threading` where the :term:`global interpreter lock` "
"(GIL) is disabled.  Free-threaded execution allows for full utilization of "
"the available processing power by running threads in parallel on available "
"CPU cores. While not all software will benefit from this automatically, "
"programs designed with threading in mind will run faster on multi-core "
"hardware."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some third-party packages, in particular ones with an :term:`extension "
"module`, may not be ready for use in a free-threaded build, and will re-"
"enable the :term:`GIL`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This document describes the implications of free threading for Python code.  "
"See :ref:`freethreading-extensions-howto` for information on how to write C "
"extensions that support the free-threaded build."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":pep:`703` – Making the Global Interpreter Lock Optional in CPython for an "
"overall description of free-threaded Python."
msgstr ""

msgid "Installation"
msgstr "Instalação"

msgid ""
"Starting with Python 3.13, the official macOS and Windows installers "
"optionally support installing free-threaded Python binaries.  The installers "
"are available at https://www.python.org/downloads/."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For information on other platforms, see the `Installing a Free-Threaded "
"Python <https://py-free-threading.github.io/installing-cpython/>`_, a "
"community-maintained installation guide for installing free-threaded Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When building CPython from source, the :option:`--disable-gil` configure "
"option should be used to build a free-threaded Python interpreter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Identifying free-threaded Python"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To check if the current interpreter supports free-threading, :option:`python "
"-VV <-V>` and :data:`sys.version` contain \"free-threading build\". The new :"
"func:`sys._is_gil_enabled` function can be used to check whether the GIL is "
"actually disabled in the running process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``sysconfig.get_config_var(\"Py_GIL_DISABLED\")`` configuration variable "
"can be used to determine whether the build supports free threading.  If the "
"variable is set to ``1``, then the build supports free threading.  This is "
"the recommended mechanism for decisions related to the build configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid "The global interpreter lock in free-threaded Python"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Free-threaded builds of CPython support optionally running with the GIL "
"enabled at runtime using the environment variable :envvar:`PYTHON_GIL` or "
"the command-line option :option:`-X gil`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The GIL may also automatically be enabled when importing a C-API extension "
"module that is not explicitly marked as supporting free threading.  A "
"warning will be printed in this case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition to individual package documentation, the following websites "
"track the status of popular packages support for free threading:"

msgid "Thread safety"
msgstr "Segurança de thread"

msgid ""
"The free-threaded build of CPython aims to provide similar thread-safety "
"behavior at the Python level to the default GIL-enabled build.  Built-in "
"types like :class:`dict`, :class:`list`, and :class:`set` use internal locks "
"to protect against concurrent modifications in ways that behave similarly to "
"the GIL.  However, Python has not historically guaranteed specific behavior "
"for concurrent modifications to these built-in types, so this should be "
"treated as a description of the current implementation, not a guarantee of "
"current or future behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's recommended to use the :class:`threading.Lock` or other synchronization "
"primitives instead of relying on the internal locks of built-in types, when "
"possible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Known limitations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This section describes known limitations of the free-threaded CPython build."
msgstr ""

msgid "Immortalization"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the free-threaded build, some objects are :term:`immortal`. Immortal "
"objects are not deallocated and have reference counts that are never "
"modified.  This is done to avoid reference count contention that would "
"prevent efficient multi-threaded scaling."
msgstr ""

msgid "As of the 3.14 release, immortalization is limited to:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Code constants: numeric literals, string literals, and tuple literals "
"composed of other constants."
msgstr ""

msgid "Strings interned by :func:`sys.intern`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Frame objects"
msgstr "Objetos de frame"

msgid ""
"It is not safe to access :attr:`frame.f_locals` from a :ref:`frame <frame-"
"objects>` object if that frame is currently executing in another thread, and "
"doing so may crash the interpreter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Iterators"
msgstr "Iteradores"

msgid ""
"It is generally not thread-safe to access the same iterator object from "
"multiple threads concurrently, and threads may see duplicate or missing "
"elements."
msgstr ""

msgid "Single-threaded performance"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The free-threaded build has additional overhead when executing Python code "
"compared to the default GIL-enabled build.  The amount of overhead depends "
"on the workload and hardware.  On the pyperformance benchmark suite, the "
"average overhead ranges from about 1% on macOS aarch64 to 8% on x86-64 Linux "
"systems."
msgstr ""

msgid "Behavioral changes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This section describes CPython behavioural changes with the free-threaded "
"build."
msgstr ""

msgid "Context variables"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the free-threaded build, the flag :data:`~sys.flags."
"thread_inherit_context` is set to true by default which causes threads "
"created with :class:`threading.Thread` to start with a copy of the :class:"
"`~contextvars.Context()` of the caller of :meth:`~threading.Thread.start`.  "
"In the default GIL-enabled build, the flag defaults to false so threads "
"start with an empty :class:`~contextvars.Context()`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Warning filters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the free-threaded build, the flag :data:`~sys.flags."
"context_aware_warnings` is set to true by default.  In the default GIL-"
"enabled build, the flag defaults to false.  If the flag is true then the :"
"class:`warnings.catch_warnings` context manager uses a context variable for "
"warning filters.  If the flag is false then :class:`~warnings."
"catch_warnings` modifies the global filters list, which is not thread-safe.  "
"See the :mod:`warnings` module for more details."
